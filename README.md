# Capstone-Project

The idea I had for a project was an Expense Tracker.
The Expense Tracker is a web application that tracks and organizes finances, offers smart visualizations, and recommends improving budget control to assist users in managing their money.
I could also add something where the user can set a goal of what they're trying to get to / purchase. Put a calculation for how long it would take to save up money for that goal.
So for example saving money to put a down payment for a vehicle.

The technologies I'll probably use are Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database.
