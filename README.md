# Capstone-Project

The idea I had for a project was an Expense Tracker.
Expense Tracker is a web application that tracks and organizes finances, offers smart visualizations, and recommends improving budget control to assist users in managing their money.

The technologies I'll probably use are Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database.
